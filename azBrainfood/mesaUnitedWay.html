    <p>Mesa United Way supports dozens of local organizations that help us fulfill our mission to provide basic services, educational programs, health care and programs that foster self-reliance. In addition, weâ€™ve created programs, and partner with national agencies, that provide essential services in areas not covered by local private, non-profit agencies.</p>
